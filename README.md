# Zalando Onboarding

## Arriving in Germany
What do you need to look for on the first weeks:
- Burgeramt registration
- Health insurance registration
- Bank account
- Tax ID

### Burgeramt registration
It's provided by the company if you bring all the registration forms and docs within the first week you start working.

### Health insurance registration
When you arrive you receive a form for the your health insurance, you can fill that or choose another one that you like.

If you fill your wife details remember to send her passport and photo too.

Also with the form provided to you there's a small business card with an email on it that you can use to send your application (no more application by mail :pray:), you just have to sign the papers and then scan it and send by email.

### Bank account
Opening a bank account on Germany is a little bit hard for people that are just arriving at the country (a little bit counterintuitive if I may say) and you can try your best going to your bank of choice with the company contract and explaining to them that you need an account to receive your salary.

You probably will have a easier time if you try to open an account on [Deutsche Bank](https://www.deutsche-bank.de/pfb/content/privatkunden.html). If  you don't care that much about opening an account on a physical bank you can try to open one on [Number26](https://number26.de), all the banking transactions are based on a mobile app and you don't need to worry about going to a physical bank anymore.

## Tips
- Probably is better to send correspondence to the Zalando office through the time you're at Town House apartments as sometime mail get sent back if they don't understand/don't find your name at the letterbox.
